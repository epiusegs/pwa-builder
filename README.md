	<h2>Altrix One PWA Builder</h2>
	<p align="center">
		<p>PWA Builder is a tool designed to help users create Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) connected to their Frappe sites. With this builder, users can connect their Frappe sites, and build app-like screens by dragging and dropping fields of their site's doctypes.</p>
	</p>

<p>
We are improving on the addition of all the possible field types and routing abilities across screens.
This is a hobby project by the developers at Aerele Technologies. Feel free to reach out to us via issues.</p>

## Steps
- Start by creating a project in the PWA Builder.
- Connect your Frappe site to the builder and give access to your Doctypes. 
- Select a Doctype and easily drag and drop fields from its metadata to create app screens.
- Export your project and download a `Frappe App`.
- Install this `Frappe App` to your actual site.
- Access your new pwa on `https://<your-site-name>/frontend`
- Using the PWA Form Doctype you can add additional forms to your application by adding the json code directly.
